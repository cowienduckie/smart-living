# SmartLiving

Project for IoT and Applications subject

## Instructions

The project has three main components: a client ReactJS application, an API server and an MVC application both using ASP .NET Core 3.1. The detailed `Installation` and `Build and Run` have been guided in README.md in their directories. The API server should be run first before running the others.
By default, the API server should be hosted at `https://localhost:5001`, the MVC application at `https://localhost:6001` and the ReactJS application at `https://localhost:3000`.
